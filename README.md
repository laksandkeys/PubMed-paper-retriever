# PubMed-paper-retriever

This was a group project for an Introduction to Data Science Course.

Group Members: Lakshmi Kanikkannan, Sungjin (Elin) Cho, Sergey Izmailyan, Tia Lal, Katherine (Kate) Wall

PROJECT DESCRIPTION - Design and implement your own Python program that can do the following:
1. A crawler module that can collect paper title, author list, publication time, and abstract from PUBMED for a given keyword (i.e., HIV) within a pre-specified time window (that is, 01/01/2020 – 09/01/2020), and the retrieved data should be saved in the CSV format. (Hint: you may use BioPython, and an example of this can be found on stackoverflow)
2. A database module that can import the CSV file to SQLite to build a database automatically. Then implement SQL code to query the publications by author’s name (i.e., input an author’s name and find out and return all his/her publications).  
3. A visualization module that can i) read the CSV file, ii) show the number of publications in each year, iii) visualize the trend of the publication numbers over time, and iv) generate and visualize the summary statistics for the publication number per year, including mean, SD, range, median, 1st to 3rd quartile. Be creative about this one (e.g., you can create your own dashboard). 
4. Implement a demo using Jupyter Notebook (that is, you will submit a .ipynb file and all other Python code files so our TAs can run the demo code step by step and check the output).
5. Finally, write a report with the following sections to describe and summarize your work:

Section 1. Program design. Please describe your ideas, draw your workflow diagram, and show the architecture design of your program.

Section 2. Implementation details. Please describe all important implementation details (e.g., modules, classes/functions, 3-rd party packages and tools).

Section 3. Results. Please include all required outputs (figures, tables, and/or numbers) in this section.

Section 4. User manual/guide. You are the developers of your tool, please write a user manual so others can read and understand how to use your tool.

FILES INCLUDED:
